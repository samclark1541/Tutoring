*About Sam Clark*

I am a recent graduate from the University of Cambridge, beginning teacher training in 2021. With two First Class degrees, a BA and an MSci in Physics,  I have an extensive grounding in mathematics and the physical sciences. I have a background teaching secondary school physics in a classroom setting as part of educational physics during my degree.

*What I am offering*

I am offering tutoring for these subjects and levels:

* Maths KS3 to KS5. This is pre-GCSE to the end of A level, including Further Maths.

* Physics KS3 to KS5. Again, pre-GCSE to the end of A level.

* Chemistry KS3 to KS4. Up to the end of GCSE.

I believe in a flexible learning approach with a highly individualised learning plan. I also have high expectations from my students, set out through clearly established goals. An emphasis is placed on instilling students with a deep sense of understanding to facilitate high achievement.
